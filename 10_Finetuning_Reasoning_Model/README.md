## Ship 🚢

The completed notebook!

#### 🏗️ BONUS ACTIVITY (FULL MARKS IF COMPLETED IN LIEU OF ABOVE NOTEBOOK):

Using the [Open R1 Math Raw](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-r1/OpenR1-Math-Raw) dataset, fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B with Unsloth to produce a reasoning model using GRPO.

> NOTE: You will need to come up with your own reward functions that correctly reward the model as it learns to reason.

### Deliverables

- A short Loom of the notebook, and a 1min. walkthrough of the application in full
